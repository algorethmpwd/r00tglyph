# SQL Injection Levels Implementation

This document provides an overview of the SQL injection levels implemented in the R00tGlyph application.

## Overview

The R00tGlyph application now includes 23 SQL injection levels, covering a wide range of SQL injection techniques and scenarios. These levels provide a comprehensive learning path for users to understand and practice SQL injection vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment.

## SQL Injection Levels

1. **Basic SQL Injection**: Learn the fundamentals of SQL injection.
2. **SQL Injection in Search**: Exploit SQL injection in search functionality.
3. **SQL Injection with UNION**: Use UNION attacks to retrieve data from other tables.
4. **Blind SQL Injection**: Exploit SQL injection when no results are returned.
5. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**: Use time delays to extract data.
6. **SQL Injection with WAF Bypass**: Learn to bypass Web Application Firewalls.
7. **Error-Based SQL Injection**: Extract data through error messages.
8. **Second-Order SQL Injection**: Exploit stored user input that is later used in SQL queries.
9. **SQL Injection in REST API**: Exploit SQL injection in RESTful APIs.
10. **NoSQL Injection**: Exploit injection vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases.
11. **GraphQL Injection**: Exploit injection vulnerabilities in GraphQL APIs.
12. **ORM-based SQL Injection**: Exploit SQL injection in Object-Relational Mapping layers.
13. **Out-of-band SQL Injection**: Use out-of-band channels to extract data.
14. **SQL Injection with Advanced WAF Bypass**: Learn advanced techniques to bypass WAFs.
15. **SQL Injection via XML**: Exploit SQL injection in XML processing.
16. **SQL Injection in WebSockets**: Exploit SQL injection in WebSocket communications.
17. **SQL Injection in Mobile App Backend**: Exploit SQL injection in mobile application backends.
18. **SQL Injection in Cloud Functions**: Exploit SQL injection in serverless cloud functions.
19. **SQL Injection via File Upload**: Exploit SQL injection in file upload processing.
20. **SQL Injection in Stored Procedures**: Exploit SQL injection in database stored procedures.
21. **SQL Injection in GraphQL API**: Exploit SQL injection in GraphQL API resolvers.
22. **SQL Injection in NoSQL Database**: Exploit injection vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases.
23. **SQL Injection in ORM Layer**: Exploit SQL injection in Object-Relational Mapping layers.

## Implementation Details

The implementation of these SQL injection levels includes:

- Database schema updates to add the new challenges
- Route implementations for each level
- HTML templates for each level
- Solution templates for each level
- Updated README.md file

## Latest Trends

The implementation incorporates the latest trends in SQL injection vulnerabilities, including:

- GraphQL API vulnerabilities
- NoSQL injection techniques
- ORM layer vulnerabilities
- WAF bypass techniques
- Mobile app backend vulnerabilities
- Cloud function vulnerabilities

## Tools Used

The following tools were used to implement the SQL injection levels:

- Python Flask for the web application
- SQLite for the database
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend
- Bootstrap for the UI components

## Implementation Scripts

The following scripts were created to implement the SQL injection levels:

- `add_new_challenges.py`: Adds the new challenges to the database
- `update_app_routes.py`: Adds routes for SQL injection levels 14-17 to app.py
- `update_app_routes_part2.py`: Adds routes for SQL injection levels 18-20 to app.py
- `update_app_routes_part3.py`: Adds routes for SQL injection levels 21-23 to app.py
- `implement_sqli_levels.py`: Main script to run all the implementations
- `final_implementation.py`: Comprehensive script that handles all implementation steps
- `verify_implementation.py`: Script to verify that all SQL injection levels are working correctly

## How to Implement

To implement the SQL injection levels, follow these steps:

1. Run the final implementation script:
   ```bash
   python final_implementation.py
   ```

2. Restart the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Verify the implementation:
   ```bash
   python verify_implementation.py
   ```

For more detailed instructions, see the `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` file.

## Conclusion

This implementation adds 16 new SQL injection levels to the R00tGlyph application, covering a wide range of SQL injection techniques and scenarios. These levels provide a comprehensive learning path for users to understand and practice SQL injection vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled environment.
